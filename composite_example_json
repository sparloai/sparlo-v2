Thermoplastic composites are recyclable but can't match thermoset performance at high temperatures and lack creep resistance. Industry produces 500K+ tons of composite waste annually, growing rapidly. Need composite system with thermoset-like performance (Tg >180°C, creep resistance, processability) that can be chemically or thermally recycled to recover fibers at >90% property retention.

Cure produces the polybenzoxazine backbone (Tg >200°C from rigid aromatic structure) with pendant catechol groups available for metal coordination.\n\nPost-cure treatment with Al3+ (from aluminum acetylacetonate or aluminum isopropoxide at 100-150°C) forms tris-catechol-Al3+ coordination crosslinks. Each catechol-Al interaction contributes 40-80 kJ/mol; the tris complex totals 120-240 kJ/mol—approaching covalent C-C bond strength. These coordination bonds are kinetically stable at neutral pH but dissociate rapidly at pH 2-4.\n\nFor recycling, immersion in 0.1M HCl at room temperature protonates catechol groups, releasing Al3+ and fragmenting the network.

At neutral pH, catechol is deprotonated (effective pKa lowered by metal coordination) and binding is extremely strong—log K ~37 for the tris complex. At pH <4, protonation competes with metal binding; at pH <2, catechol is fully protonated and Al3+ is released as soluble AlCl3.\n\nThe equilibrium shifts cleanly with pH: 3 Cat2- + Al3+ ⇌ [Al(Cat)3]3-. This is completely orthogonal to temperature—you can have Tg >200°C with recycling at room temperature. No thermal trigger can accidentally cleave the bonds during service.",

Diels-Alder retro-reaction at 120°C overlaps with service; vitrimer exchange at 180°C overlaps with service. But pH 2-4 cannot occur inside an aircraft structure. This provides the cleanest separation between service and recycling conditions of any approach we evaluated."

The aromatic backbone provides Tg >180°C while ester linkages throughout the network enable glycolysis recycling.\n\nDuring service, the hydrophobic aromatic matrix limits water access to ester bonds—uncatalyzed hydrolysis rate is ~10^-10 s^-1, meaning effectively zero degradation over 20-year service life. For recycling, immersion in excess ethylene glycol at 180-200°C with transesterification catalyst (zinc acetate at 0.1-0.5 wt%, titanium isopropoxide) drives ester exchange, fragmenting the network into soluble oligomers within 2-4 hours.\n\nCarbon fibers are released intact as the matrix dissolves around them. The oligomeric products are not waste—they're polyol feedstock for repolymerization, closing the loop on both fiber and matrix. This is the same chemistry BASF uses to recycle millions of tons of polyurethane foam annually, just applied to a different ester-containing network.",
        "why_it_works": "Transesterification equilibrium is driven by glycol concentration. At 10-100x molar excess of ethylene glycol, the equilibrium strongly favors network fragmentation into glycol-terminated oligomers. The reaction proceeds through nucleophilic attack of glycol hydroxyl on ester carbonyl, catalyzed by Lewis acid coordination to carbonyl oxygen. Aromatic esters have higher activation energy (~80 kJ/mol vs. ~60 kJ/mol for aliphatic) but proceed readily at 180-200°C with catalyst.\n\nCritically, the same reaction is negligibly slow at service conditions. Without catalyst and excess glycol, ester hydrolysis at neutral pH and 80°C has a half-life of centuries. The trigger is truly orthogonal—you cannot accidentally glycolyze your wing spar."

          "why_it_works": "Vinylogous urethane exchange proceeds through transamination, catalyzed by free amine or Lewis acid. Without catalyst, activation energy is ~100 kJ/mol and exchange half-life at 180°C is years. With catalyst, activation energy drops to ~60 kJ/mol and exchange occurs in minutes. Encapsulating catalyst shifts the effective Tv above the capsule melting point."

    "what_id_actually_do": "If this were my project, I'd start with the glycolyzable aromatic polyester—not because it's the most innovative, but because it has the clearest path to success. The chemistry is proven at industrial scale for PU recycling, the monomers are commercial, and we're essentially asking 'can we make a high-Tg version of something that already works?' That's a formulation optimization problem, not a science problem.\n\nI'd run the polyester and vitrimer tracks in parallel for the first 12 months. The vitrimer has Mallinda as a reference point showing aerospace Tg is achievable, and the locked-catalyst concept addresses the creep concern that's been the main industry objection. If either track hits a wall, I have a fallback.\n\nThe catechol-metal approach is genuinely exciting—room-temperature recycling with dilute acid would be transformative—but I'd keep it as a longer-term bet. The custom monomer synthesis and oxidation sensitivity add risk that I wouldn't want on the critical path. Fund it at 20% of the portfolio and let it mature while the polyester track de-risks the business case.\n\nOne thing I'd do differently than most: I'd engage a fiber manufacturer (Toray, Hexcel, Toho Tenax) from day one. The fiber-matrix interface is going to matter, and having sizing compatibility validated early avoids a nasty surprise at composite scale. Plus, they have the most to gain from a recyclable composite—their fiber currently goes to landfill at end of life."
