# Chat with Reports

Ask follow-up questions about your reports using the chat feature.

## How It Works

The chat feature lets you have a conversation about your report:
- Ask clarifying questions about the analysis
- Request more details on specific topics
- Get explanations of technical concepts
- Explore related areas not covered in the report

## Using Chat

### Starting a Conversation

1. Open any completed report
2. Click the chat icon or "Ask a question" button
3. Type your question
4. Press Enter or click Send

### Example Questions

Good questions to ask:
- "Can you explain this section in simpler terms?"
- "What are the risks not mentioned in this analysis?"
- "How does this compare to [competitor]?"
- "What sources did you use for this information?"

### Chat Tips

- Be specific with your questions
- Reference specific sections when asking follow-ups
- Ask one question at a time for clearer answers
- Use the chat to dig deeper into interesting findings

## Limitations

The chat feature:
- Is based on the report content and available information
- Cannot browse the internet for new information
- May not have information about very recent events
- Works best with focused, specific questions

## Getting Human Help

If the chat cannot answer your question:
- Click "Talk to a human" for support assistance
- Your conversation will be sent to our team
- We'll respond via email as soon as possible
