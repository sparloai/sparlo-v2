      "designChallenge": "Commercial kitchens, hospitals, and universities generate 1-5 tons/week of food waste. Hauling costs $150-300/ton and rising. Composting requires space and management. Anaerobic digestion needs scale (100+ tons/day) to be economical. On-site dehydrators exist but consume 800-1200 kWh/ton, take 12-24 hours per batch, produce output that's not consistently compostable, and cost $30-50K for a 200 lb/day unit. Need on-site solution that reduces food waste volume by 80%+, processes 500+ lbs/day, uses <200 kWh/ton, produces stable output (compostable or fuel), and costs <$15K installed.",
