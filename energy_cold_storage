    "brief": "Refrigerated delivery vans for groceries and pharmaceuticals run diesel-powered compressor units that consume 30-40% of total vehicle fuel. Electric vans eliminate the engine but refrigeration still drains 40-60% of battery capacity, cutting delivery range in half. Current solutions are eutectic plates (limited hold time), oversized batteries (cost/weight), or trailer-mounted diesel gensets (defeats the purpose). Need refrigeration approach that maintains -20°C to +5°C for 8-hour delivery routes while consuming <15% of a 60kWh EV battery. Must handle 50+ door openings per route.

The winning strategy isn't better refrigeration; it's eliminating the need for it. By combining supermarket-proven infiltration control (70-85% door loss reduction), step-change insulation (VIP at 5x conventional performance), and depot-charged thermal mass, we can achieve 5-8 kWh total consumption—well under your 9 kWh target—using technologies that exist today.",

        "what_it_is": "Fundamentally reframe the vehicle as a thermal distribution system, not a refrigeration plant. Load pre-made ice slurry (30% ice fraction in water/glycol mixture) at the depot into an insulated tank. Circulate slurry through heat exchangers distributed in the cargo space using a small pump (~100W). Zero on-board refrigeration—all cold is manufactured at the depot using cheap grid electricity.\n\nThe depot ice slurry generator operates overnight using off-peak electricity at $0.05-0.10/kWh, compared to on-vehicle electrical equivalent of $0.30-0.50/kWh (accounting for battery capacity value and range impact). This 6-10x cost differential fundamentally changes the economics of cold chain logistics.\n\nThe vehicle carries 200-300 kg of ice slurry providing 60-100 kWh of thermal capacity—far exceeding the 8-hour requirement even with 50+ door openings. The only on-vehicle electrical consumption is the circulation pump and fans, totaling 0.8-1.5 kWh over an 8-hour route. This preserves virtually all EV range for driving.",
        "why_it_works": "Ice slurry exploits the highest latent heat of any practical thermal storage medium: 334 kJ/kg for the water-ice phase transition. Unlike solid ice, slurry is pumpable, enabling distributed cooling throughout the cargo space via circulation. The depot generates ice using efficient industrial equipment (COP 3-4) with cheap off-peak electricity, rather than inefficient mobile equipment (COP 1.5-2) with expensive on-vehicle electricity. The vehicle only needs to circulate the pre-made cold, not generate it.",
        "why_this_one": "This concept represents the most fundamental reframe of the problem—questioning whether on-vehicle refrigeration is necessary at all. The 6-10x cost differential between depot and mobile electricity creates compelling economics for any fleet with fixed depot infrastructure. If successful, this architecture could become the industry standard for EV cold chain, similar to how containerization transformed shipping logistics."

Vapor compression at these temperatures achieves COP of only 1.5-2.0, meaning every watt of cooling requires 0.5-0.7 watts of electrical input. But the real killer is transient loads—door openings inject massive thermal pulses that overwhelm steady-state calculations. A system designed for 500W steady-state heat ingress must handle 5-10 kW peaks during door recovery, forcing oversized equipment that runs inefficiently most of the time."

        "what_it_is": "A defense-in-depth thermal architecture combining four proven technologies into a coherent system. First, vacuum insulated panels (VIP) replace or supplement conventional foam insulation, achieving R-30 per inch versus R-6 for polyurethane—a 5x improvement that reduces wall heat ingress from 800-1,200W to 160-240W. Second, high-density salt hydrate phase change materials (CaCl2·6H2O at 192 kJ/kg for frozen, Na2SO4·10H2O at 254 kJ/kg for chilled buffering) provide 35-45 kWh of thermal storage capacity, handling all transient loads from door openings without active cooling intervention.\n\nThird, a retrofit air curtain + strip door system adapted from supermarket practice reduces door opening infiltration by 70-85%. The air curtain creates a laminar airflow barrier at 3-5 m/s across the door opening, while overlapping PVC strips provide a physical barrier that parts around packages. Fourth, a small variable-speed compressor (300-500W) sized for steady-state heat ingress only—not recovery—runs at optimal efficiency when needed rather than cycling inefficiently.\n\nThe system is orchestrated by IoT thermal monitoring that predicts temperature trajectory based on route data, ambient conditions, and door opening history. The compressor activates only when the thermal model predicts temperature will approach compliance limits, enabling 'thermal coasting' through most of the route.",
        "why_it_works": "Each subsystem addresses a different thermal load component at its source. VIP reduces conduction through walls (Q = U×A×ΔT) by reducing U by 5-6x. PCM provides thermal mass to absorb transient loads (door openings) without temperature excursion, exploiting the 334 kJ/kg latent heat of phase change. Air curtains reduce infiltration mass flow (ṁ in Q = ṁ×cp×ΔT) by 70-85%. The small compressor then only needs to handle the residual steady-state load of ~200-400W rather than the 2-4 kW peaks that conventional systems must accommodate. Running a small compressor at optimal load is far more efficient than running an oversized compressor at partial load."

Combined effectiveness: 75-90% infiltration reduction based on supermarket data from Foster et al. (2006).\n\nThis is the highest-impact, lowest-cost intervention available.

    "what_id_actually_do": "If this were my fleet, I'd move in three parallel tracks starting tomorrow.\n\nFirst, I'd order air curtain + strip door kits for every vehicle in the fleet. This is a no-brainer—$500-1,500 per vehicle, 2-week installation, 30-50% thermal load reduction. The ROI is measured in months, not years. I'd make this mandatory and track compliance through driver feedback and energy monitoring. This alone might get some vehicles close to the 9 kWh target on mild days.\n\nSecond, I'd select 5-10 vehicles for a VIP + PCM pilot. I'd work with va-Q-tec or a similar supplier to develop a retrofit kit for my most common van model. The goal is to validate the integrated system achieving 5-8 kWh consumption over a real 8-hour route with 50+ door openings. I'd instrument these vehicles heavily—temperature sensors throughout the cargo space, energy monitoring on every component, GPS-correlated door opening logs. Six months of data would tell me whether to roll out fleet-wide or iterate on the design.\n\nThird, I'd commission a cargo composition analysis across all routes. If the data shows that 80% of routes have <25% frozen cargo, I'd seriously consider the separated frozen vault architecture. This could be even simpler and cheaper than the full integrated system while achieving similar energy performance.\n\nThe ice slurry concept is the most exciting long-term, but I wouldn't bet the fleet on it without proving the vehicle-side system works first. Once I have depot infrastructure investment on the table, I need confidence that the thermal distribution approach actually delivers. I'd run a bench-scale validation in parallel with the vehicle pilots.\n\nWhat I would not do is wait for perfect information. The air curtain intervention is so obviously positive that delaying it to study more options is just leaving money on the table. Start there, learn fast, and iterate."
