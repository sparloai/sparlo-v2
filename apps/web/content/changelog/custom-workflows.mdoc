## Visual Workflow Builder

- Test workflows before deploying

## 100+ Integrations

Connect to popular services including:
- Slack, Discord, and Teams for notifications
- GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket for development workflows
- Zapier and Make for extended integration possibilities
- Custom webhooks for any service

## Templates

Get started quickly with pre-built workflow templates:
- Automated project creation
- Issue escalation rules
- Status update notifications
- Daily team summaries

Workflows are available on Pro and Enterprise plans. Visit the [Automation](/automation) section to start building.
