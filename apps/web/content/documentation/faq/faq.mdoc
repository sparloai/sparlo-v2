## Getting Started

### What is Sparlo?

Sparlo is an AI-powered engineering research platform. You describe an engineering problem, and Sparlo delivers comprehensive research including innovation concepts from across industries, technical validation, IP landscape, and strategic recommendations — all in about 25 minutes.

### Do I need an engineering background to use Sparlo?

No. Sparlo is designed for anyone working on engineering challenges — from engineers and researchers to product managers and founders. Just describe your problem in plain language, and Sparlo handles the research.

### Is there a free trial?

Contact us at help@sparlo.ai to discuss trial options.

## Creating Reports

### How long does report generation take?

Most reports complete in 20-30 minutes. This thorough research process is what makes Sparlo valuable — we're not just searching, we're analyzing your problem, exploring cross-industry solutions, and synthesizing actionable insights.

### Why does it take ~25 minutes?

Sparlo conducts genuine research, not just a search. The process includes:
- Framing your problem from multiple perspectives
- Searching across industries for relevant innovations
- Generating and evaluating potential approaches
- Synthesizing findings into a structured report

This depth takes time but produces much better results.

### Can I cancel a report mid-generation?

Once you click "Run Analysis," the research process begins on our servers. You can't cancel mid-generation, but you can close your browser — we'll email you when it's ready.

### What file types can I attach?

You can attach:
- **Documents**: PDF, DOCX
- **Images**: PNG, JPG

Limits: Up to 5 files, maximum 10MB each.

### What makes a good problem statement?

Good problem statements include:
- Specific numbers and measurements
- Clear constraints (what you can't do)
- Context about what you've tried
- Request for cross-industry approaches

See [Writing Effective Problems](/docs/creating-reports/writing-problems) for examples.

## Using Reports

### Can I ask questions about my report?

Yes! Every report includes a chat feature. Ask follow-up questions, request more detail on specific concepts, or explore "what if" scenarios.

### Are there limits on chat messages?

Yes, to ensure quality for everyone:
- 30 messages per hour
- 150 messages per day

If you hit a limit, wait for it to reset and continue.

### Can I share my report publicly?

Yes. Click "Share" to generate a link anyone can use to view your report. Share links don't expire and don't require a Sparlo account to view.

### Can I download my report as PDF?

Yes. Click "Export PDF" to download a formatted PDF of your report for offline viewing or sharing.

### How long are my reports stored?

Reports are retained while your subscription is active. Archived reports are also retained. If you cancel your subscription, consider exporting important reports first.

## Billing and Plans

### What's included in each pricing tier?

| Plan | Price | Reports/Month | Team Seats |
|------|-------|---------------|------------|
| Core | $199/mo | ~10 | 1 |
| Pro | $499/mo | ~30 | 5 |
| Max | $999/mo | ~70 | 10 |

All plans include chat, PDF export, share links, and file attachments.

### Can I upgrade or downgrade anytime?

Yes. Go to Settings → Billing to change your plan. Upgrades take effect immediately. Downgrades take effect at your next billing date.

### What happens when I reach my monthly limit?

You'll need to wait for your next billing cycle (when your limit resets) or upgrade to a higher plan. You can still view existing reports and use chat.

### What payment methods do you accept?

We accept major credit cards via Stripe: Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover.

### What's your refund policy?

To request a refund, email help@sparlo.ai with your account email and reason. We handle refunds on a case-by-case basis, typically responding within 2 business days.

## Teams

### How do team accounts work?

With Pro or Max plans, you can invite team members who can:
- View all team reports
- Chat with any team report
- Create new reports using the shared quota

Team owners manage members and billing.

### Can team members see each other's reports?

Yes. All reports created within a team account are visible to all team members. This enables collaboration and avoids duplicate research.

---

## Security and Privacy

### Is my engineering data secure?

Yes. Your data is protected by:
- **Encryption in transit and at rest** — All data is encrypted
- **Middleware encryption** — We use encrypted processing pipelines
- **SOC 2 compliant providers** — Our infrastructure partners (Anthropic, Supabase, Railway, Inngest) are all SOC 2 compliant
- **Row-level security** — Database-level isolation between accounts
- **No casual browsing** — We cannot casually view your reports or data

### Do you use my data to train AI models?

No. Your engineering problems and reports are never used to train AI models. Anthropic (Claude) explicitly does not use API data for training. Your research remains your intellectual property.

### Who can see my reports?

- **Personal accounts**: Only you
- **Team accounts**: You and your team members
- **Share links**: Anyone with the link (if you generate one)

You control who sees your research.

### Can I use Sparlo on mobile?

Yes, though we recommend desktop for creating reports. Mobile works well for viewing reports and using chat.
