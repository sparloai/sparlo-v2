Each Sparlo report follows a consistent structure. Here's what you'll find in each section.

## Executive Summary

**What it is**: A condensed overview of your report's key findings and recommendations.

**What you'll find**:
- The core problem as understood by Sparlo
- Top 2-3 most promising approaches
- Key considerations
- Recommended next steps

**How to use it**: Start here to get oriented. If you only have 2 minutes, this gives you the essential takeaways. Use it to decide which concepts to explore further.

## Problem Analysis

**What it is**: Your engineering challenge examined from multiple perspectives.

**What you'll find**:
- Restatement of your problem with additional context
- Underlying technical challenges identified
- Key constraints and their implications
- Related problem domains that might offer solutions

**How to use it**: Validate that Sparlo understood your problem correctly. This framing influences all subsequent research — if something seems off, use the Chat to clarify or refine.

## Innovation Concepts

**What it is**: Specific approaches drawn from cross-industry research that could address your problem.

**What you'll find**:
- Multiple distinct concepts (typically 3-6)
- For each concept:
  - What it is and how it works
  - Where it's used successfully
  - Why it might fit your problem
  - Key technical considerations
  - Potential adaptations needed

**How to use it**: This is the heart of your report. Read through each concept to understand the range of possibilities. Don't dismiss unfamiliar approaches — cross-industry solutions are often the most valuable.

## Technical Validation

**What it is**: Feasibility assessment for the proposed concepts.

**What you'll find**:
- Technical viability analysis
- Implementation complexity estimates
- Potential challenges and risks
- Dependency on other technologies or materials
- Compatibility with your stated constraints

**How to use it**: Use this section to narrow down which concepts are realistic for your situation. Some concepts may be technically sound but impractical given your constraints.

## IP Landscape

**What it is**: Overview of relevant patents and prior art in this space.

**What you'll find**:
- Key patents related to your problem domain
- Patent holders and their focus areas
- Freedom to operate considerations
- Academic publications and research
- Existing commercial solutions

**How to use it**: Understand what's already been done and who's active in this space. This informs both your technical direction and potential IP strategy.

## Risk Assessment

**What it is**: Analysis of potential challenges and tradeoffs for each approach.

**What you'll find**:
- Technical risks (what could go wrong)
- Implementation challenges
- Scalability considerations
- Cost implications
- Dependency risks

**How to use it**: Every solution has tradeoffs. Use this section to understand what you'd be taking on with each approach. Consider which risks are acceptable given your priorities.

## Strategic Recommendations

**What it is**: Prioritized guidance on how to move forward.

**What you'll find**:
- Recommended concepts to explore further
- Suggested next steps
- Quick wins vs. longer-term opportunities
- Testing and validation approaches
- Resource considerations

**How to use it**: This is your action plan. Start with the recommended next steps and work through them systematically. Use the Chat feature to get more specific guidance on any recommendation.
